- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheShadowandwolves acc The Leo
I don´t know what to write. I don´t know whats github, but uploading some codes here (and for sure donwnload some content from here). 
Enjoy, using my codes for personal use. And please do not use it to cheat for your homeworks! But I am not going to watch over you, it is your choice!
Side note: I don't take any responsibility over it! Not everything here may be correctly working!

- 👀 I’m interested in:
Computers, like hardware and gaming. Love designing and programming is in my second list. I am not good at all, but want to become better!
Love soccer. Watching movies and play games.
Side note: This was when I started studying, now I don't have time anymore for this. I still like hardware and technologies. But I find newer hobbies to use my time wisely.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
Bachelor for Computer Science. Yeah, you get it! I am able to learn something!!!
Note 2022: Yep, that what I thought, now I just want to burst in flames. But don't think I am not able to learn! I am clever as hell. Just not for some stuff.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
probably with myself. Joking. For now, Idk.
Note 2022: Please collaborate with me. Yeah, now I know things. Searching for a job, need to use some knowledge of my studies in practice! Any ideas?

- 📫 How to reach me:
Never! For sure my friends, but I am not a guy who loves messaging. But you can try!
I am friendly...
Note 2022: Possible you asking yourself why I am making these notes? Well, its for me. It is a long time and could potencially become a good remembering for later years.
I am still friendly, if you want to reach me, try LinkedIn or my Instagram: theShadowandwolves

- see you and enjoy your live!!!!
