- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheShadowandwolves acc The Leo
I am a student studing for my Bachelor of Computer Science. Currently third year. 
Enjoy, using my codes for personal use. And please do not use it to cheat for your homeworks! But I am not going to watch over you, it is your choice!
Side note: I don't take any responsibility over it! Not everything here may be correctly working!
A lot of the repositories are just start ups for new projects and may contain unfinished material.

Computers, like hardware and gaming. Love designing and programming is in my second list. I am not good at all, but want to become better!
Love soccer. Watching movies and playing games. 
Love to code and do my own website. 
Side note: This was when I started studying, now I don't have time anymore for this. I still like hardware and technologies.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
Bachelor for Computer Science. Yeah, you get it! I am able to learn something!!!
Note 2022: Yep, that what I thought, now I just want to burst in flames. But don't think I am not able to learn! I am clever as hell. Just not for some stuff.
